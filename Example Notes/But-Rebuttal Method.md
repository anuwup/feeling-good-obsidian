| But Column                                                    | But Rebuttal                                                                               |

| I really *should* mow the lawn, but I'm just not in the mood. | I'll feel more like it once I get started. When I'm done I'll feel terrific.               |
| But now it's so long it would take forever.                   | It won't take that much extra time with the power mower. I can always do a part of it now. |
| But I'm too tired.                                            | So just do some of it and rest.                                                            |
| I'd rather rest now or watch TV.                              | I can, but I won't feel very good about it knowing this chore is hanging over my head.     |
| But I'm just too lazy to do it today.                         | That can't be trueâ€“I've done it on numerous occassions in the past.                        |
