| I never do anything right.     | #overgeneralization                                                               | Nonsense! I do a lot of things right.                                                                                                                                                             |
| I’m always late.               | #overgeneralization                                                               | I’m not *always* late. That’s ridiculous. Think of all the times I’ve been on time. If I’m late more often than I’d like, I’ll work on this problem and develop a method for being more punctual. |
| Everyone will look down on me. | #mind-reading<br>#overgeneralization<br>#All-or-nothing <br>#Fortune-teller-error | Someone may be disappointed that I’m late but it’s not the end of the world. Maybe the meeting won’t even start on time.                                                                          |

I’m not “a jerk.”                                                                                                                                                                   |

I may appear foolish if I come in late, but this doesn’t make me a fool. Everyone is late sometimes.                                                              |
